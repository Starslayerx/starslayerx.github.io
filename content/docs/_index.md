# Welcome

Welcome to the documentation section.

This site now uses the Hugo Book theme, which is designed for creating clean, organized documentation.

## Features

- **Clean Layout**: Minimal and focused on content
- **Table of Contents**: Automatic TOC generation
- **Search**: Built-in search functionality
- **Dark Mode**: Supports light/dark/auto themes
- **Multi-language**: Support for multiple languages

## Getting Started

You can organize your content in this `docs` folder. Create subdirectories for different sections, and the theme will automatically generate a navigation menu from your folder structure.

Your existing blog posts in the `posts` folder are still accessible.
