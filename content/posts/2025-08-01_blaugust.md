ðŸŽˆ Oh hello, August! It's time for Blaugust.

### Blaugust Begins: Writing as a Develpoer Habit

This year, I'm joining **Blaugust** - a month-long blogging challenge that encourage consistent writing throught August.
For develpoers, blogging isn't just sharing, it's about orgainzing thoughts, documenting ideas, and creating term references.

### What I Plan to Write

Here is what I aim to cover this month:

- Daily dev partices: tools, logging, project structure patterns
- Python ecosystem: FastAPI, Pydantic, Langchain, Pytest and more
- AI project logs: buliding AI agents and orchestration workflows
- Architecture notes: async patterns, micorservice, data flow
- Learning notes & translation of blogs: deep dive into code and quality tech atricles

I'm not necessarily writing one post per day - some days I might write multiple posts in advance - but the goal is to publish daily with a focus on consistency, reusability, and value.

### Writing Platform and Setup

This blog is build with **Hugo + Github Pages**, using the `narrow` theme.
Markdown keeps things simple, and version control is headled vai Git.

- RSS feed is available (blogroll exchange is welcome!)
