# Unit 3. Discussing Code

## vocabulary - Modifiers

When discussing code, _modifiers_ can be extremely useful for making your feedback constructive and precise.

- _modifiers_: words that change the meaning of a sentence

For example, a colleague asks:

What do you think of the website?

- Response 1: It's good When I click something it loads very quickly and I can navigate it easyily without any instructions.

- Response 2: It's good! It's very _responsive_ and can be navigated _intuitively_.

By using _technical adjectives and adverbs_, Response 2 sounds more clear and professional.
There are some modifiers can be used in your opinion on technical topics:

- **scalable**
- **robust**
- **consistent**
- **user-friendly**
- **reusable**
- **seamlessly**

Examples:

1. I like the interface of GitHub; it's very _easy to use and understand_.  
   I like the interface of GitHub; it's very **user-friendly**.

2. Developers should follow _the same_ coding practices.  
   Developers should follow **consistent** coding practices.

3. Can you explain why a _strong_ code review process is important?  
   Can you explain why a **robust** code review process is important?

4. New features should be integrated _smoothly and without disruptions_.  
   New features should be integrated **seamlessly** (无缝的).

5. I want you to focus on building components that _can be used many times_.  
   I want you to focus on building components that **reusable**.

6. Our infrastructure needs to be _able to be made larger_ to handle an increase in users.  
   Our infrastructure needs to be **scalable** to handle an increase in users.

## grammer - Placement of Modifiers

When a modifier isn't used in correct position, it can make the sentence confusing for a reader/listner.

- Incorrect: "The algorithm solved(verb) quickly the problem(noun)."
- Correct: "The algorithm solved the problem quickly."  
   OR: "The algorithm quickly solved the problem."

Example:

1. **maintainable**: It's important to write code.  
   It's important to write maintainable code.

2. **briefly**: The comment should describe what each function does.  
   The comment should briefly describle what each function does.

3. **accurately**: Using a version control system helps to track changes.  
   Using a version control system helps to accutately track changes.

4. **critical**: Joe mentioned several issues that need immediate attention.  
   Joe mentioned several critical issues that are needed immediate attention.

5. **constructive**: I want to thank the team for providing feedback.  
   I want to thank the team for providing constructive feedback.

6. **versatile** (多才多艺的): I spoke with the team and they liked our framework.
